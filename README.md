#Arduino SMS Door Bell

----------
The Arduino UNO SMS Door Bell uses an Arduino UNO, and a connection to computer with Internet connection, to send an SMS text message to the door bell recipient. The inspiration for this project is simple: there is no doorbell in my house. The project uses an LCD display, multiple push buttons and resistors, and a potentiometer, to capture user input and display output to the user. Sending a text is done using a connection between the Arduino UNO board and a computer that is capable of executing a python script that utilizes the Twilio API. The user has the option to toggle through a list of names, the names of the residents of the house, and then "confirm," which sends the displayed name a text notifying them that a person has requested them at the door. This helps solve the problem of inefficient, anarchic, and insecure door bells.
